**A simplified way to install apks, and interact with the new Windows Subsystem for Android**
**adb install xyz NO LONGER!** Running this software installs it. You can choose whether to make it the default action for .apks too!
Either double-click an apk (with it set to the default action - in the install), or Right-Click an apk and select `Install in WSA-SimpleSideload`.

# Other commands:
-  `SimpleSideload.exe unlink` - Uninstall this program. Either with the EXE in `%AppData%\platform-tools\`, or a downladed copy.
-  `SimpleSideload.exe reinstall` - Gives another opportunity to add file associations & the Context Menu option.
-  `SimpleSideload.exe settings` - Opens WSA's settings window
-  `SimpleSideload.exe push <File>` - Move a file to the WSA's Downloads folder. Add <Optional:Destination on Android> to push to another folder. Downloads (default) is: -  `./storage/emulated/0/Download`
-  `SimpleSideload.exe <apkname/fullpath>` - Install an APK manually from the command line

## To update:
  Run `SimpleSideload.exe reinstall` in the directory you downloaded the updated program to.
  
# It runs adb commands for you
On install, if there isn't a platform-tools folder in the same directory, it automagically downloads the latest version, and extracts to `%AppData%\platform-tools`. It also copies itself there.
 The context menu interaction and arguments are all redirected into there, to work with ADB.
 
# Note
Make sure to have adb & this program closed to install, or reinstall. Having adb open could cause it to crash. Check your Task Manager.
